# Differential-gene-expression
In this project I have a bash script that: I) get the stats of RNA-Seq fastq files; II) Map the fatq files to the reference genome; III) get the number of map reads; and IV) quantify and normalize the number of reads. The reads are from Mus Musculus, from Brain, Heart and Liver cells.  The final goal was to identify differential expressed genes between them.
